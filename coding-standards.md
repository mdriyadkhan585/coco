# **Coco Coding Standards**

## **Introduction**

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices for contributing to the Coco programming language. Adhering to these standards ensures code consistency, readability, and maintainability across the project.

## **General Guidelines**

1. **Consistency**: Follow the coding style used in the existing codebase. Consistent formatting makes the code easier to read and maintain.

2. **Readability**: Write clear and understandable code. Use descriptive variable and function names, and avoid complex or convoluted logic.

3. **Documentation**: Document your code using comments and docstrings. Explain the purpose of functions, classes, and complex algorithms.

## **Code Formatting**

1. **Indentation**:
   - Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
   - Avoid using tabs.

2. **Line Length**:
   - Limit lines to 80 characters to enhance readability.

3. **Braces**:
   - Use braces for all control statements (`if`, `for`, `while`, etc.), even if they contain a single statement.
   - Place the opening brace on the same line as the control statement. Place the closing brace on a new line.

   ```coco
   // Example:
   if (condition) {
       // code block
   } else {
       // code block
   }
   ```

4. **Spacing**:
   - Use a single space between operators and after commas.
   - Do not add extra spaces inside parentheses or brackets.

   ```coco
   // Example:
   let result = a + b;
   ```

## **Naming Conventions**

1. **Variables**:
   - Use `camelCase` for variable names (e.g., `userName`, `totalAmount`).

2. **Functions**:
   - Use `camelCase` for function names (e.g., `calculateTotal`, `fetchData`).

3. **Classes**:
   - Use `PascalCase` for class names (e.g., `UserManager`, `PaymentProcessor`).

4. **Constants**:
   - Use `UPPER_CASE` for constants (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`).

## **Comments and Documentation**

1. **Comments**:
   - Use comments to explain the purpose of complex logic and code blocks.
   - Avoid redundant comments that state the obvious.

2. **Docstrings**:
   - Provide docstrings for all public functions, classes, and modules.
   - Include a description of the function’s purpose, parameters, and return values.

   ```coco
   /**
    * Calculates the total amount including tax.
    *
    * @param amount The initial amount.
    * @param taxRate The tax rate as a percentage.
    * @return The total amount including tax.
    */
   fn calculateTotal(amount: f64, taxRate: f64) -> f64 {
       // code
   }
   ```

## **Error Handling**

1. **Error Reporting**:
   - Use appropriate error handling mechanisms for managing exceptions and errors.
   - Provide meaningful error messages that help identify the cause of the problem.

2. **Validation**:
   - Validate inputs and handle edge cases to avoid runtime errors.

## **Testing**

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes.
   - Ensure that tests cover various edge cases and scenarios.

2. **Test Coverage**:
   - Aim for high test coverage but focus on meaningful test cases rather than achieving 100% coverage.

3. **Naming Tests**:
   - Use descriptive names for test cases to clearly indicate what is being tested.

   ```coco
   // Example:
   test "calculateTotal should return correct total with tax" {
       // test code
   }
   ```

## **Version Control**

1. **Commit Messages**:
   - Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
   - Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug").

   ```text
   # Example:
   Fix issue with user login validation
   ```

2. **Branching**:
   - Use feature branches for new features or bug fixes.
   - Follow the naming convention `feature/description` or `bugfix/description`.

## **Code Reviews**

1. **Review Process**:
   - Review code for adherence to coding standards, correctness, and performance.
   - Provide constructive feedback and request changes if necessary.

2. **Approval**:
   - Ensure that code is reviewed and approved by at least one other contributor before merging.

## **Tools**

1. **Linters**:
   - Use linters to enforce coding standards and detect potential issues.
   - Configure linters according to the project's standards.

2. **Formatters**:
   - Use automated code formatters to maintain consistent code style.

## **Contact**

For any questions or clarification regarding the coding standards, please reach out to the maintainers via GitHub Issues or the project’s community channels.
